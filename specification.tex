\section{System Specifications}
\label{sec:specifications}
The proposed radio communication system switches between QPSK and QAM-64 modulation, at a fixed transmit power and bandwidth, in order to obtain adaptable sound quality.  The system use the 2.4GHz ISM band with a carrier frequency of 2.415GHz. The system is designed for a transmission distance of 10 meter in an indoor environment with a bandwidth of \bw kHz. Some key specifications of the system is listed in table \ref{tab:specs_data} andÂ \ref{tab:specs_ber}. Table \ref{tab:specs_data} shows the parameters for the data path and the values are listed for low / high data rate transmission. Table \ref{tab:specs_ber} shows parameters for the simpler BER path.

The burst format for the transmitted data is shown in figure \ref{fig:burst_format}. The bursts are different when using QPSK and QAM-64 modulation, because the same number of e.g. training symbols maps to a different number of bits. The data packages (a and b) is transmitted continuously with the indicated guard period. The BER packages is very small compared to the data packages, and is only transmitted ones per received data package. Thus no guard period is specified for these packages.
